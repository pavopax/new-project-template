All code and programs go here. Other names for this directory are: /src, /source, or /programs

If you write both code scripts (.py, .R, etc) _and_ code notebooks (.Rmd, .ipynb), consider putting the notebooks
into a separate folder `/notebooks`. See `advanced` branch.

If your scripts must be run in a certain order, for example to produce intermediate output data, then consider numbering them: 1_load.R, 2_transform.R, etc. See advanced branch for /cache folder.
